I have contributed with most of the code, with some exceptions.
We started working in the classroom and editing some code together,
but after we included github version control in our project we have mostly
worked on different stuff. The github scripts contribution speaks for it self.
I have made the core system, like the Player mechanics and functionality, implementation of
guns, zombie AI, ragdoll physics for zombie, state machines for the player and zombie.
This then includes all the scripts connected to the player and zombie.
I have also made the Main Menu, in game menu, mission handlers, damage handlers,
weapon switch and animations, in game UI.

I have also made the Snowstorm map.
